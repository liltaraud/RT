# RT
A real-time raytracer written in C, using OpenCL and SDL2

This is a collaboration of 4 people.
Henrik Caspar, Florian Declerck, Th√©ophile Trosseau, and me.


I was responsible for the rendering pipeline and GPU operations. You will find my work in the GPU Kernel, and in the OpenCL and GPU data transfer operations functions.
I strongly invite you to read "RT - Pipeline presentation" to get a condensed overview of the thinking behind the rendering pipeline design.
